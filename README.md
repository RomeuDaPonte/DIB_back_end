I create this project in order to learn node.js.

This is not a final version off the project, i will improve over time.

This project needs a front-end that you can fine in my repos. The name is: DIB_front_end

to try this you have to have mongodb installed and node.js.

// Intall node packages
npm install

// run the project
node index.js
